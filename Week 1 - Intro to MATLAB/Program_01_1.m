% Program Description:
% The purpose of this program is to demonstrate common arithmetic
% operations in MATLAB using variables as well as hard-coded values

% Clear the command window and all variables
clc  % clc clears the contents of the command window
clear  % clear clears the command window and all variables

% Output of the title and author to the command window.
tutorialName = "Program_01_1";
name = "";
assistedBy = "";
fprintf("Output for %s written by %s, with assistance from %s.\n\n", tutorialName, name, assistedBy)

% Declare Variables a and b where a has the value 5 and b has the value 3


% Create the following arithmetic operations
% Multiply variables a and b
multiplication =

% Calculate 10 to the power of b plus 6
exponentiation =

% Calculate a times b plus b squared (there are two general solutions)
bSquared =
